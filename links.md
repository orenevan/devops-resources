#Jenkins 

Now what about the choice between declarative vs. scripted pipelines for a new project? The answer to that question is most definitely the declarative pipeline.
The development industry has largely moved toward a declarative programming model for CI/CD pipelines. Both GitHub Actions and GitLab CI support only YAML pipelines, which are very similar to declarative Jenkins pipelines.

Furthermore, declarative pipelines are easier to maintain and they tend to have a lower learning curve. The declarative syntax is the best approach to use when new CI/CD workflows are built.
